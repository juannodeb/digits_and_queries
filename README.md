### About

The Digits & Queries repository has a couple of ruby files:

[digits](https://github.com/juannodeb/digits_and_queries/blob/master/digits.rb) being a straight-forward method that returns the sum of the digits within the already given numbers until it gets a one-digit number.

[digitsGame](https://github.com/juannodeb/digits_and_queries/blob/master/digitsGame.rb) would be the game version of it, where the program asks the user to type any number they'd want and just like digits, it would return the one-digit number from the sum of the given number.

On the other hand, there's [queries](https://github.com/juannodeb/digits_and_queries/blob/master/queries/queries.txt) a txt file with the answers of how many queries will be generated after each block of code is executed (images to support my answers are within the [queries folder](https://github.com/juannodeb/digits_and_queries/tree/master/queries)).
